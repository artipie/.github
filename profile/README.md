Artipie is a software repository manager constructor, and self-hosted free service.

You can build your own repository server from Artipie components or run Artipie server on your private network.
Check our wiki pages for details: https://github.com/artipie/artipie/wiki

[Artipie roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/artipie/projects/3) on the third quarter:
 * validate README files in all our projects. All files should have actual description and worked links.
 * implement Hex repository's adapter. The adapter will allow hostingÂ private Erlang / Elixir packages using artipie as repositories manager.
 * implement ability to plug in a custom storage. This feature will allow using a custom storage to host binary data with no changes in artipie module.
 * change asto project to make it multiple modules. It should allow adding a new storage implementation as a new module of this project (not a new repository).
